                    <p>The <i>Naja Pallida</i> snake is a native of Western Africa.
                        When threatened, it shoots venom into the eyes of its adversary, briefly blinding them and giving them time to flee. 
                        This impact is explored in zoological laboratories. When a snake bites a human, little cloats form, which might cause the individual to die (ABC Science).</i></p>
                    <p>The Institute for Life Sciences is well-known for its participation in snake venom research.
                        This is because a previous pupil, Jory van Thiel, has been infatuated with snakes since he was a child.
                        He once came to see us at college and told us about his fascination with snakes, how he acted in self-defense rather than malice, and how he even had his own pet snake.  
                        During his travels to Asia a snake spat venom in his eyes which blinded him temporarily <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/nieuws/2021/02/leidse-biologiestudenten-in-kijk-over-spugende-cobras"> and made him understand the defence mechanism</a> of the <i>Naja Pallida. </i>
                    A study which got him <a href="https://twitter.com/PCramers/status/1354434677818458112">published in Science!</a></p>
                    <p>Snakes, as Jory once noted, are normally fairly sweet, but that doesn't mean their means of self-defense isn't harmful, if not lethal.
                        In the laboratory, researchers are attempting to establish what makes the venom so lethal, as well as whether there are any benefits to the venom that could be used in the development of an anti-venom or the therapy of certain heart diseases.</p>
                        Rat hearts were exposed to venom ex vivo in order to uncover a possible cure for excessive blood loss, specific cardiac diseases, and to find an anti-venom.
                        This is accomplished using a Langendorff setup that includes a heart attached to the Langendorff and venom administered through a tube. </p> 
                    <p>This setup is done at the Institute of Life Sciences with venom from the <i>Naja Pallida</i> and the <i>Crotalus atrox</i>.
                        These venoms were tested on rat hearts ex vivo and human neuroblastoma cells (SKNAS) in vitro.
                        When we look at the results in vitro, we can observe that cells deteriorate quickly.
                        This effect is reduced when the inhibitor Varespladib is added. </p>
                    <p>When considering the effect seen ex vivo, which means the venom is administered via the Langendorff setup, we can see the venom's effect on the heart, but we can also see the peak pattern that is formed.
                        The reason for this is that when the rat's heart is removed, Ringer buffer is provided, causing the heart to beat somewhat longer than usual when taken from the body.
                        When the venom is delivered, we can detect a peak pattern that indicates cardiac contractions.
                        The researchers on the lab manually calculated data from the experiment, such as the number of peaks, maximal contraction force (the peak height), and beats per minute. 
                        The disadvantage is that the technique is extremely error-prone, and bias can readily creep in. 
                        This method is automated to avoid avoidable errors and save time for the researchers. </p>
                    <p>I participated in this project with two other students, which was commissioned by the Institute of Life Sciences' Zoology department and was carried out under the supervision of Dr. Micheal Liem. </p>
                    <img src="images/science_joryvanthiel.jpeg" alt="Some image"> 
                    <p>In R, a for loop was used to automate the peak identification process.
                        We created a for-loop that examines the data file and determines if a peak is a peak by determining whether it has crossed a "hill."
                        When you first enter the dataset, it will rise upwards with a peak before descending again.
                        Every time the loop runs, it checks this procedure and records the number of peaks in a new file.
                        In addition, another loop was created that calculates the beats per minute (bpm) during a 5-second period. 
                        This appears to be a very short time, but keep in mind that an experiment like this one typically lasts 30 to 45 minutes and that physiological consequences like cell degregation and blood clot development occur extremely quickly when exposed to snake venom. </p>
                    <p>As with any experiment that produces peaks, we must also consider that some noise will be introduced.
                        Noise is defined as peaks that appear on the graph but were not caused by the experiment.
                        They were most likely caused by an analist accidentally bumping against the table, improper Langendorff setups, or any number of minor factors.
                        To reduce the noise from the graph, we used a technique known as thresholding.
                        This means that we examine a graph and determine how high the peaks are on average.
                        This is the contraction force or strength.
                        Peaks that are significantly smaller than the general peaks will not pass the threshold and will be filtered out. 
                        <br>
                        Sounds simple enough, doesn't it?
                        Well, we discovered that the more experiments performed, the more different the peak graph may appear.
                        Meaning, if an analist is jittery after his seventh cup of coffee and is having a clumsy day, significantly more noise will be noticed on the graph, and they may not all be the same height.
                        Another explanation could be that a different setup was employed, or that the venom was used at a different concentration. </p>
                        <img src="images/00_ld4.png" alt="Some image"> 
                        <p>To provide the commissioning party with the most accurate information, we have chosen to let the analist chose the threshold for themself. This is done by writting a function in the loop which doesn't establish a fixed value as a threshold but rather lets the user choose it.</p>
                        <p>Even while sometimes we forget the rest of the Institute for Life Sciences doesn't love the language R as much as we do, it did dawn on us that we couldn't simply hand in an R script and call it a day. For this reason we made a R Shiny app, which is an UI written purely with R and a little HTML and CSS for the look.
                            In this app, the user will be presented with a README, and a page where they may upload the data file. The graphs will then be generated for them and they can afterwards choose a threshold.</p>

                    <p><i>Art is the Queen of all Sciences Communicating Knowledge to All the Generations of the World. <strong>(Leonardo da Vinci)</strong></i></p>
                    <p>The Dutch city Utrecht is one of the most beautiful places in the world, and a beacon of art and education, housing more than 21 universities and colleges and 400 art installations.
                        Not long ago when I was lying sick in bed, scrolling the internet for some distraction and at photographs of art pieces, when I stumbled upon the R package by Edwin Thoen (GitHub: EdwinTh) named dutchmasters. 
                        I was immediately inspired.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a Data Scientist you are constantly making graphs that convey to someone either a difference or correlation. That proces is important because looking at large files of data can be daunting and makes us prone to making mistakes.
                        To make a statistical graphs more appealing, we use distinctive colors. To add to the color palettes currently available in R, I used the beauty of a city. </p>
                        <img src="images/2014_langenoord_boukjelootsma.jpg" alt="Some image"> 
                    <p>After gathering some photographs of street art found in Utrecht, I extracted the color palettes with the site ginifab.com.
                        The hex codes from the images were stored in a variable, specific to every art piece.</p> 
                    <img src="images/rcolorUtrecht_thewonders_hexcodes.png" alt="Some image"> 
                    <p>The saving of those color codes means that the package that I named <i>rcolorUtrecht</i> now contains a function with which you can make a graph using the color codes I stored in that function.</p>
                    <p>My next step was to use a function for the scale_fill option and the scale_color option. The colors will be the same however when using custom color palette packages in R, and let's say we want to make a bar chart that compares the honey production per month in a given year, we must add the code <i>scale_fill_rcolorUtrecht(palette = "the_wonders")</i>. <br>
                    Now let's say we want to make a scatterplot that seeks to verify whether there is a correlation between cat breeds and tail lengths (yes, I chose this example for a specific reason) when you would use the code <i>scale_color_rcolorUtrecht(palette = "the_wonders")</i>. </p>
                    <img src="images/rcolorUtrecht_microscope.png" alt="Some image">

                </h2> 
                <div class="content__text">
                    <p>Google.org provides a number of datasets on Dengue Fever and flue cases. I downloaded two files that contained the number of dengue fever cases and flu cases which were already present in the GitHub repository of the course. 
                        These files provide cases from 2002 till 2015. </p>
                    <p>I began my analysis with the following steps:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Importing the data into R.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Tidying the data.</strong>
                            The datasets showed a column for each country which makes the process of data visualization difficult. Additionally, I corrected the class types of the variables.</li>
                            <li><strong>Joining the Dengue fever dataset with the Flu dataset using full_join.</strong></li>
                        </ul> </p>
                    <img src="images/A_black_image.jpg" alt="Some image">
                    <p><i><strong>A note beforehand: </strong> analysis requires you to upload data files into SQLite using the DBeaver software. 
                        When downloading DBeaver you are presented with a key password which is different for everyone. Because of sercurity reasons, I will not be sharing my password but I have nevertheless showed how to export data from within R to DBeaver, 
                        how to inspect and modify the data in SQLite using DBeaver and then how to import it back into R. 
                        This doesn't mean you cannot reproduce the this analysis however you should have downloaded DBeaver prior.
                        This ensures the reproducibility of the analysis whilst keeping it safe.</i></p>
                    <p>In R, I joined the Dengue and Flu datasets and visualized the number of cases using ggplot2. The dataset contains information from 2004 to 2016, which is a while back but may give us an idea of the progression of flu and dengue cases.
                        After data visualization what was seen was that generally the number of flu cases does not dramatically increase or decrease in countries. The highest number of flu cases is seen in Canada, Mexico, Poland, South Africa and the United States. 
                        A surprising sight was that in Peru the cases of flu has been dropping steadily over the years.</p>

                    <p>I did the same data visualization for the number of Dengue Fever cases. Dengue Fever is brought on after infection of the <i>Flaviviridae virus</i>.
                    The virus is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQwOvNe9-Yo">spread by mosquitoes often seen in tropical and sub-tropical countries.</a>
                    The dataset containing number of Dengue Fever cases is from 2002 to 2016. After plotting it was seen that in Venezuela the highest number of infections is seen over the years. 
                    Strangely the year 2008 saw a spike in infection in all countries.</p>

                </h2> 
                <div class="content__text"> 
                    <p>As every TV ad from the 50s says, breakfast is the most important meal of the day! It provides us with nutrients to start our day at school or work, gives us energy to go to the gym (or run to catch the bus), and if we believe the 50s cereal ad from Grape-Nuts, breakfast can even "steady a man's nerves". I'd check for low blood pressure first, but to each his own.</p>
                    <p>The dataset 80 cereals is relatively tidy but the data needed cleaning. The column, or variable, names were extremely abbreviated, the nutrient measurements didn't contain units and the dataset contained a column for ratings on the cereals but when, where and by whom the ratings were collected was unknown.</p>
                    <p>Before I start any analysis in R, I want to make sure that when I import the dataset I collect enough information on the data so that I will not have to return to the original source. This not only helps me understand what I'm doing but also benefits a reader who will most likely only read my report.
                        This is why I began with making the variable names complete and removed the column ratings. <br>
                        My main objective was to compare the sugar and sodium content of the different cereals, so I selected these columns and performed a Shapiro-Wilk test to check for normality. <br>
                        There are 80 cereals and 7 cereal manufacturers and I wanted to determine if the variance within the groups were equal. I did this by installing the car package which contains the Levene Test package.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/breakfast.jpg" alt="Some image"> 
                    <p>Now lastly, I had to return to my original question again, which was does the sugar and sodium content really differ between brands? <br>
                    A great way to determine this is by performing a one-sample t-test. To make the analysis more interactive, I used the DT package for showing the columns, the plotly package for generating graphs and an user-defined function that returns the nutritional content of each cereal when typing the name.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>This was a fun way to practice!</strong><br>

                    <p>The Docs (or Documents folder) is simply the outside of the house, and the project folders in the Docs are rooms. A README file is a file in which we write information on the project, where we got the data from that we're using, references and instructions.</p>

                </h2> 
                <div class="content__text"> 
                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in catastrophic events over the entire world and devestated families by the loss of a loved one. </p>
                    <p>Because the COVID-19, or rather the SARS-COV-2 virus, was a novel virus and left even the best epidemiologists puzzled, people have worked around the clock to make a vaccin that would lead to the immunization of people to prevent further deaths. 
                        We've all seen the many video's and news reports on the virus, its effect on the economy and the overwhelming effect on people. Media outlets have attempted to provide us with a bigger picture of the virus by showing the numbers but we have rarely put a face to the sadness.</p>
                    <p>Earlier I attempted to reproduce the analysis by <a href="https://github.com/riffomonas/vaccination_attitudes">Riffomonas</a> who sought to determine the vaccine intent globally in August 2020.</p>
                    <p><i>Btw, if you haven't read that yet <a href="future_ambitions.html">check it out here.</a></i></p>
                    <p>While, Riffomonas sucessfully set up a reproducible analysis, it also showed that France, Italy and the United States showed the most reluctance to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The course instructors provided me with a dataset that contained the number of reported COVID-19 cases from 2020 to 2022,
                            retrieved from <a href="https://github.com/DataScienceILC/tlsc-dsfb26v-20_workflows">here. </a> With this dataset I visualize the number of COVID-19 cases from 2020 till 2022 and the number of deaths as a result of COVID-19 (related complications).</p>
                    <p>This analysis was a great exercise to practice with params (parameters). </p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-daily-new-cases-covid-19-eueea-country">The ECDC website </a>has collected the number of reported COVID-19 infections and deaths in a dataset which I downloaded. In R, I uploaded the CSV file and filtered all data for France in 2020. Using ggplot2 I visualized the number of cases for each month while also making a plot for the number of deaths.</p>
                    <img src="images/009_covid.png" alt="Some image"> 
                    <p>After plotting the data for cases and deaths we can see that the number of cases in May till June is relatively high however if we then look at the number of deaths in the same month, the peaks skyrocket. This may be explained by the virus being new in France, 
                        and the country much like the rest of Europe being not fully prepared for a pandemic of that scale. 
                        When looking at the number of cases in October till January we see very high peaks, but the number of deaths is almost half, meaning while many more people were infected in the winter, much less died as a result of infection. 
                        This is, I believe, due to measurements being taken such as routine testing, social distancing and medical care.</p>

                <div class="content__text"> 
                    <p>The <i>C. elegans</i>is a nematode and is naturally found in soil and eat bacteria that would cause the decay of decomposing plants. In a laboratory however they are often used as an animal model because of their small genome and physical transparancy. At the laboratory of the Institute for Life Sciences, a study has been conducted by J. Louter </p>
                    <img src="images/001_celegans.jpg" alt="Some image"> 
                    <p>The main objective of the experiment was to establish whether the compounds Decane, Nephtalene and 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene causes a decrease in the number of offpsring seen in the
                        <i>C. elegans</i> and if so, in what concentrations. Ethanol was used as a positive control, meaning the number of offspring will definitely drop when being exposed to it. S-medium was used as a negative control, 
                        which means nothing will happen when the <i>C. elegans </i>is exposed to it. 68 hours after exposure the number of offspring were counted under a microscope.</p> 
                    <p>In R, I loaded the dataset and inspected it. The column RawData contains the number of offspring after 68 hours of exposure to the compounds. The column compName shows the compound to which <i>C. elegans </i>was exposed to and lastly the column
                    compConcentration shows the concentration of the compound.</p>
                    <p>A problem I came across was that the column compConcentration was classified as a character rather than numeric. The reason for this is because the value separator was a comma instead of a fullstop. A way of changing is is by using the <i>as.numeric</i> function however that will result in values being removed. Alternatively, using the str_replace function works better and will not remove any values.</p>
                    <p><strong>df$compConcentration <- df$compConcentration %>% str_replace("," , ".")</strong><br>
                    <strong>df$compConcentration <- df$compConcentration %>% as.numeric()</strong></p>
                    <img src="images/001_celegans_plot1.png" alt="Some image"> 
                    <p>This dataset was a good way to practice with data normalization considering the positively skewed plot. This makes the data difficult to read, which means I needed to do a log10  transformation.</p>
                    <img src="images/001_celegans_plot2.png" alt="Some image"> 
                    <p>A log10 transformation helps with interpreting results. The higher the concentration, the less offspring is counted. After this, I normalized the data for the negative control. Why? To get a more relative view of the experiment. If I calculate the mean value for the negative control and then normalize those values, I can compare each data point with that normalized control. 
                        This way we may get a more relative conclusion of the plot. </p>
                    <img src="images/001_celegans_plot3.png" alt="Some image"> 
                    <p>What can be concluded from this graph is that with increasing concentrations the number of offspring also drop. However what we can see now, what we couldn't before is that Naphthalene shows the most severe drop in offspring, 
                        becoming more severe with higher concentrations.</p>
                    <p>This is a predictable conclusion, but also has shortcomings because it says little about the IC50 and EC50. A way to establish a conclusion on these factors would be to use the drc package.</p>

                    <p>We've all been there. You're starting a (pet) project thinking you've got it all under control but halfway through you realize how much work it actually is. Searches for sources, data management, writing your first draft, rewriting, etc. Then it dawns on you. Next time you'll break down the project into small bite size tasks!</p>
                    <p>Great, right? But then when you're finished you find yourself with 50 separate Word document files, the graphs in an Excel document and the sources in some text file. Using RMarkdown and the Guerilla Method fixes many of these issues.
                        <br>
                        <i>Btw, if you haven't read my piece on Data Management using the Guerilla Method yet, go find it on the start page!</i>
                        <br>
                        <p>During the minor Data Science, I was happy to view each assignment as a singular task, however I realized it does need to be combined eventually into a collection. 
                            A method in which I did this, was my putting in the RMarkdown yaml that the document must be rended into a bookdown after knitting.</p>

                    <p>All projects found on my portfolio were made in separate RMarkdown files and then rendered into a Bookdown which may be found in <a href="https://github.com/cherjuliette/dsfb2_bookdown">my GitHub repository</a>.</p>
